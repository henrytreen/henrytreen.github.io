		<h1>first journal entry</h1>
		<p>9/22 - last class we linked our folders and created a folder on github. I already had my about me, journal, and projects linked in my code so when it appears on a website it functions well. Although my laptop had issues and kept erroring, Ms. Jacob's figured out how to fix it.
		
		<ul>
			<li>First, open your terminal and navigate to your folder by typing "cd ./desktop/henrytreen.github.io</li>
			<li>Add changes by typing "git add ."</li>
			<li>Commit changes by adding a message that describes your changes by typing "git commit -m "your message here"<li/>
			<li>Launch online by typing "git push"</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>second journal entry</h1>
		<p>9/26 - today we learned set up our person cards. I chose an image of Harry Kane as he is my favorite english footballer. We looked again at how to link a website and reviewd what the main parts of html code actually mean and do.

		<h1>third journal entry</h1>
		<p>10/6 - today I put text on my website under each of my three images linking to projects, journal, and about me. It took me a bit to center and align but eventually I got the hang of it. Along with that, I linked two projects in my projects section of my website.
