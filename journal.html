		<h1>first journal entry</h1>
		<p>9/22 - last class we linked our folders and created a folder on github. I already had my about me, journal, and projects linked in my code so when it appears on a website it functions well. Although my laptop had issues and kept erroring, Ms. Jacob's figured out how to fix it.
		<ul>
			<li>First, open your terminal and navigate to your folder by typing "cd ./desktop/henrytreen.github.io
			<li>Add changes by typing "git add ."</li>
			<li>Commit changes by adding a message that describes your changes by typing "git commit -m "your message here"<li/>
			<li>Launch online by typing "git push"</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>second journal entry</h1>
		<p>9/26 - today we learned set up our person cards. I chose an image of Harry Kane as he is my favorite english footballer. We looked again at how to link a website and reviewd what the main parts of html code actually mean and do.

	<div id=entry3>s
		<h1>third journal entry</h1>
		<p>10/6 - today I put text on my website under each of my three images linking to projects, journal, and about me. It took me a bit to center and align but eventually I got the hang of it. Along with that, I linked two projects in my projects section of my website. 

	<div id=entry4>
		<h1>fourth journal entry</h1>
		<p>10/24 - today I finished my jumpscare along with figuring out how to add sound once the candy basket is clicked on. It is now linked on my projects page. Ms. Jacobs helped me use opacity commands in my code to make images disappear and I also figured out how to make a sound play once clicking on an image.  
	<div id=entry5>
		<h1>fifth journal entry</h1>
		<p>10/27 - finished my jumpscare and linked it on my projects page. We used event listens so once the candy basket is clicked a sound will play and the candy basket's opacity will go to 0 and it will be replaced by my jumpscare, which orignally was one large ghoul but I changed it to a grid as it looked better. I also added a background image to my projects page and Ms. Jacobs helped me alter the color of the links and remove the underline. As for the event listeners video, my three questions are; How do html event listeners different from other code languages - What are the key resitrictions of event listeners - What are the most common html elements that can be used wiht event listeners - in my jumpscare I used "click"
	<div id=entry6>
		<h1>sixth journal entry</h1>
		<p>11/10 - today we experimented with functions, which are an element of javascript in our case. essentially, a function is a recipe that allows us to take in data and processes it, creating an output. Our function command is makeOranges, and by assigning a variable to the term "fruit", which is just a word used to alter the output, and using interval commands we figured out how to make an image spawn every set interval seconds on a page. Next we attempted to figure out how to make each image disappear - I added an event listener for "fruit" and used the "mouseenter" command. This must be in the funciton as we need to add it to every orange image so once every image is hovered over the image disappears. 
	<div id=entry7>
		<h1>seventh journal entry</h1>
		<p>11/28 - today we asked questions about what we are confused about or want to learn more of. Here are mine. What does console.log do? How would you add multiple event listeners to the same image (ex. hover and then click)? How do IF statements work? When does the code auto indent and why is this? Something new I came across was that you can use chat gpt to explain code which is extremely helpful. 
	<div id=entry8>
		<h1>eighth journal entry</h1>
		<p>12/12 - today we created a loop using countervariables. First, we created a function, which creates a div. Then the for loop runs from 1-100, by using makeBird(counter) and creates a div with a corresopnding number displayed. 
	<div id=entry9>
		<h1>ninth journal entry</h1>
		<p>1/9 - today we learned how to make arrays. First we assigned an event listener to click, something we have already learned in the past. Then, in my code I wanted to randomly pick names. Using math random and round to select a number 0 through 4, and then using the names.innerText=brawlstars[random] command, it selects one of the names corresponding to the number selected, and appears in the console.
