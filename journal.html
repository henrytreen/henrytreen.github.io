		<h1>first journal entry</h1>
		<p>9/22 - last class we linked our folders and created a folder on github. I already had my about me, journal, and projects linked in my code so when it appears on a website it functions well. Although my laptop had issues and kept erroring, Ms. Jacob's figured out how to fix it.
		
		<ul>
			<li>First, open your terminal and navigate to your folder by typing "cd ./desktop/henrytreen.github.io</li>
			<li>Add changes by typing "git add ."</li>
			<li>Commit changes by adding a message that describes your changes by typing "git commit -m "your message here"<li/>
			<li>Launch online by typing "git push"</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>second journal entry</h1>
		<p>9/26 - today we learned set up our person cards. I chose an image of Harry Kane as he is my favorite english footballer. We looked again at how to link a website and reviewd what the main parts of html code actually mean and do.

	<div id=entry3>
		<h1>third journal entry</h1>
		<p>10/6 - today I put text on my website under each of my three images linking to projects, journal, and about me. It took me a bit to center and align but eventually I got the hang of it. Along with that, I linked two projects in my projects section of my website. 

	<div id=entry4>
		<h1>fourth journal entry</h1>
		<p>10/24 - today I finished my jumpscare along with figuring out how to add sound once the candy basket is clicked on. It is now linked on my projects page. Ms. Jacobs helped me use opacity commands in my code to make images disappear and I also figured out how to make a sound play once clicking on an image.  
	<div id=entry5>
		<h1>fifth journal entry</h1>
		<p>10/27 - finished my jumpscare and linked it on my projects page. We used event listens so once the candy basket is clicked a sound will play and the candy basket's opacity will go to 0 and it will be replaced by my jumpscare, which orignally was one large ghoul but I changed it to a grid as it looked better. I also added a background image to my projects page and Ms. Jacobs helped me alter the color of the links and remove the underline. As for the event listeners video, my three questions are; How do html event listeners different from other code languages - What are the key resitrictions of event listeners - What are the most common html elements that can be used wiht event listeners - in my jumpscare I used "click"
